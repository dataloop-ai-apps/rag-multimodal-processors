## Making changes to the repo
When adding functionality to the repo, first review the "architecture" directory to see what the product requirements, specs, and record on the project are. 

When adding additional functionality, make any functionality that can be used by other document preprocessing types to be shared in common directories.

## Relevant context
When reviewing the code, read docs only from the following directories:
- chunkers
- extractors
- pipeline

## Core Operating Modes

### Plan Mode (Default)
- Start in PLAN mode for every new task
- Print `# Mode: PLAN` at the beginning of each response
- Gather information and create plans without making changes
- Output full updated plan in every response
- Only move to ACT mode when user types `ACT`

### Act Mode
- Print `# Mode: ACT` at the beginning of each response
- Execute approved plans and make code changes
- Return to PLAN mode after completing actions
- Document all changes in Memory Bank

Do NOT make any changes to code without explicity approval.
